## This app

It's an old project (about 2... years) to have notes from a D&D campaign by small editable text cards.
I stared in React + Redux but now I'm going to migrate it to NextJS and try and update all the logic I did at the time implementing the improvements of React and NextJS.
I'm going to try a full new stack NextJS with React, Prisma (ORM) and PostgreSQL. Documentation guide me.

# Docs

This project has three docs.
First this Readme, that's a small presentation of the project and how started and why I did it.
Second Rdocs, contains a pool of ideas to implement in the future (nice to have), a basic app path and the db elements models.
Third Rdiary, a summary of the daily work, ideas, stopers, fails, etc
And why the docs R name... I like to say something brilliant, but it's to have the three docs toghether.
