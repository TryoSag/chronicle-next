## This app
  It's an old project (about 2 years) to have notes from a D&D campaign by small editable text cards.
  I stared in React + Redux but now I'm going to migrate it to NextJS and try and update all the logic I did at the time implementing the improvements of React and NextJS.
  I'm going to try a full new stack NextJS with React, Prisma (ORM) and PostgreSQL. Documentation guide me.
